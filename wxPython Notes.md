# Introduction

​	Due to the simplicity in coding using the Python language, I have decided to use it as the main tool/language for building desktop applications (or maybe web applications as well) for my company products and projects or for side projects. 

​	Good thing about Python is that it comes with it's own Graphical User Interface (GUI) toolkit, **tkinter**. Now after learning the basic and some advanced stuffs, I've come to realize that tkinter was great for basic and simple projects but lacks some essential features out of the box for building comples desktop applications.
